## Strings and vectors

```{r}
string_vec = c("my", "name", "is", "jeff")

# Returns TRUE for last one because case sensitive
str_detect(string_vec, "jeff")

# Returns FALSE for last one because case sensitive
str_detect(string_vec, "Jeff")

str_replace(string_vec, "jeff", "zak")

# Replace with empty space
str_replace(string_vec, "e", "")
```

Note that strings are case-sensitive!

```{r}
string_vec = c(
  "i think we all rule for participating",
  "i think i have been caught",
  "i think this will be quite fun actually",
  "it will be fun, i think"
)

str_detect(string_vec, "i think")

# Use ^ to represent beginning of line
# Only shows when it starts the phrase
str_detect(string_vec, "^i think")

# For end of phrase instead of beginning
str_detect(string_vec, "i think$")
```

```{r}
string_vec = c(
  "Y'all remember Pres. HW Bush?",
  "I saw a green bush",
  "BBQ and Bushwalking at Molonglo Gorge",
  "BUSH -- LIVE IN CONCERT!!"
)

str_detect(string_vec, "bush")

str_detect(string_vec, "Bush")

str_detect(string_vec, "[Bb]ush")
```

```{r}
string_vec = c(
  '7th inning stretch',
  '1st half soon to begin. Texas won the toss.',
  'she is 5 feet 4 inches tall',
  '3AM - cant sleep :('
  )

# Which phrases start with 1st, 2nd, 3rd etc?
str_detect(string_vec, "^[0-9][a-zA-Z]")
```

```{r}
string_vec = c(
  'Its 7:11 in the evening',
  'want to go to 7-11?',
  'my flight is AA711',
  'NetBios: scanning ip 203.167.114.66'
  )

# Want to find 7, then anything, then 11
str_detect(string_vec, "7.11")
```

```{r}
string_vec = c(
  'The CI is [2, 5]',
  ':-]',
  ':-[',
  'I found the answer on pages [6-7]'
  )

# Want to search for something that actually has a square open bracket
# Extra backslash because \ is itself a special chararacter
str_detect(string_vec, "\\[")
```

## Why factors are weird

```{r}
factor_vec = factor(c("male", "male", "female", "female"))
factor_vec

# Converts females to 1, males to 2
as.numeric(factor_vec)

factor_vec = fct_relevel(factor_vec, "male")
factor_vec

# Converts males to 1, females to 2
as.numeric(factor_vec)
```

See? Some weird stuff happens in background if you don't keep track of what's going on with your labels and factor level orderings.
